1: It would be unrealistic to memorize Slick syntax because it is very specific. Rather, we should focus on skills that have maximm return on investment.(ROI)
1a: Slick is but one library among thousands of java libraries. Consequently, we are better served by learning skills such as how to decode and implement java libraries.
The important part of what we are doing is problem solving and pattern recognition, i.e., computational thinking.
2: An Array is an ordered list containing one data type.
3: We make an array like this: 
String[] michael = {"john","sally","sue","stormy"};
int[] myFavoriteNumbers = new int[42];


4: An ArrayList can contain multiple data types.
5: To make an ArrayList with a specific type, we use <> : 
ArrayList<stuff> things = new ArrayList();
things.add(moreStuff);
6: I identified the boolean, int, and Object methods.
7: An array is static, i.e., it has a fixed size, whereas arraylists are dynamic, i.e., their size can change.
8: We could make a health counter for an avatar by doing this: 

int health = 5;
if(playerIsHit) {
health -=1 }
